## 📊 BigMart Sales Prediction  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the sales of products in different BigMart stores using machine learning. The dataset contains various features like item type, item weight, outlet size, and more to help predict the `Item_Outlet_Sales`.  

### 🚀 Features  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering  
- Model Training & Evaluation  
- Deployment-ready script (`sales.py`)  
- Dockerfile for containerization  

### 🏗️ Machine Learning Models Used  
The following regression algorithms were implemented and compared:  
1. **Linear Regression (LR)**  
2. **Random Forest Regressor**  
3. **Gradient Boosting (GB)**  
4. **XGBoost (XGB)**

### 📦 Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BigMart-Sales-Prediction.git
   cd BigMart-Sales-Prediction
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the prediction script:  
   ```bash
   python sales.py
   ```  

### 🐳 Docker Setup  
To run the project in a container:  
```bash
docker build -t bigmart-sales .
docker run -p 5000:5000 bigmart-sales
```

### 📈 Results & Evaluation  
The models were evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). Among them, **XGBoost** and **Gradient Boosting** performed the best in terms of accuracy.
